#Let's Talk

Let's Talk is a live public forum in which users can feel free to talk to simply make a text channel or contribute to an already existing one. Although it was intially made to help users reach out during the pandemic, Let's Talk can truly be used for any topic of discussion. Enjoy!

Technical Aspects:

I've used Redux and React as the two frameworks the app is really build upon. Redux was crucial in user state management. Without it, it would be a struggle to pull information like the user id, profile picture and etc. React was used to easily manage various components like the text channels, messaging features and etc. All in all, much was learned during the creation of Let's Talk!
